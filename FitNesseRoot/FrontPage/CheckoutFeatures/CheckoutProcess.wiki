    And the customer has the following items in the cart:
      | Item      | Quantity |
      | Product A | 1        |
      | Product B | 3        |
    When the customer proceeds to checkout
    And the following items are in stock:
      | Item      | Price | Quantity |
      | Product A | 5     | 1        |
      | Product B | 3     | 3        |
